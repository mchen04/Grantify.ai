# Grantify.ai Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

Grantify.ai is an AI-powered grant matching platform that helps users find relevant grants based on their preferences and interests. The system will:

1. Extract grant data daily from Grants.gov
2. Use AI (Gemini API / DeepSeek) to categorize grants
3. Provide personalized grant recommendations
4. Allow users to save, apply for, and ignore grants
5. Learn from user interactions to improve recommendations

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js (React)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand or Redux
- **Deployment**: Vercel

### Backend
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express/Fastify
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **AI Integration**: Gemini API / DeepSeek
- **Cron Jobs**: node-cron for scheduled tasks

## Core Components

### Project Setup and Infrastructure
- Git repository configuration
- Next.js frontend project with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Backend Node.js project
- Supabase instance configuration
- CI/CD pipeline

### Database and Authentication
- Database schema in Supabase
- Indexes for performance optimization
- Authentication with Supabase Auth
- User profile and preferences storage
- Basic API endpoints

### Data Pipeline
- Cron job for daily data extraction
- XML parser for Grants.gov data
- Data transformation logic
- Error handling and logging
- Delta updates

### Data Parsing and Cleaning
- XML parser for Grants.gov data
- `TextCleaner` service using Mistral-7B-Instruct via OpenRouter
- Grant description cleaning and contact information standardization
- Caching and rate limiting for AI requests
- Fallback mechanisms

### AI Integration
- Gemini API / DeepSeek integration
- Grant categorization logic
- Embeddings for similarity matching
- AI scoring system

### Core Features
- Grant search functionality
- Filtering and sorting options
- User preferences management
- Grant recommendations
- User dashboard

## Technical Considerations

### Data Pipeline
- The XML file from Grants.gov can be large, so streaming or chunked processing may be necessary
- Consider using a queue system (BullMQ, RabbitMQ) for parallel processing
- Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- Set up monitoring for the daily import process

### Security
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement CSRF protection
- Regularly update dependencies

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features
- Email notifications for new matching grants
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- In-app messaging system
- Mobile app version

### AI Enhancements
- Improved grant categorization
- Personalized grant summaries
- Grant application assistance
- Deadline reminders
- Success probability estimation

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Data Quality**: Grants.gov data may be inconsistent or have unexpected formats
  - *Mitigation*: Robust error handling and data validation
  
- **AI Performance**: AI categorization may not be accurate enough
  - *Mitigation*: Hybrid approach with keyword matching as fallback

- **Scalability Issues**: System may slow down with large datasets
  - *Mitigation*: Proper indexing, caching, and database optimization

### Business Risks
- **User Adoption**: Users may not find the AI recommendations valuable
  - *Mitigation*: Gather feedback early and iterate on the recommendation algorithm

- **Competitor Analysis**: Similar services may exist
  - *Mitigation*: Focus on unique AI capabilities and user experience

## Success Metrics

- Number of registered users
- User retention rate
- Grant application conversion rate
- AI recommendation accuracy
- System performance metrics
- User satisfaction scores

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building Grantify.ai over a 12-week period, with clear phases and milestones. The plan addresses technical considerations, risks, and future enhancements to ensure a successful project delivery.
